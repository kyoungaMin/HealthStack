Redesign a section-based wellness web UI
for a Korean service called “밥이약이다”.

This is NOT a medical service.
It is a lifestyle health content platform inspired by traditional Korean medicine,
focused on food, ingredients, and daily well-being.

Your goal is to define:
- A lively, modern visual system
- Clear UI sections
- Fonts, colors, spacing that can be implemented in React + Tailwind

---

## Visual Direction
- Mood: healthy glow (건강한 생기), warm sunlight, fresh ingredients
- Feeling: alive, modern, calm, trustworthy
- Style: editorial wellness website, not an app dashboard

Avoid:
- Hospital or clinic design
- Dark or muted UI
- Overly minimal or cold tech styles
- Aggressive commercial layouts

---

## Color System
Use a lemon 🍋 + apricot 🍑 palette suitable for UI implementation.

- Background: warm off-white with a subtle lemon tint
- Primary accent: soft apricot / warm orange
- Secondary accent: pale yellow / warm cream
- Text: warm dark gray (not black)
- Borders: very light, subtle

Define colors in a way that can map to design tokens.

---

## Typography
- Korean-friendly fonts
- Editorial, human, calm
- Suitable for long-form reading
- Clear hierarchy using size and spacing (not color)

Avoid techy or corporate fonts.

---

## Layout Structure (No Tabs)
Design a single-page, vertical scroll layout with these sections:

1. Hero search section (headline + input + button)
2. Recommended foods summary section
3. Video recommendation section (exactly 3 items)
4. Ingredient explanation section (benefits + cautions)
5. Quiet purchase information section (list-style)

Each section should:
- Answer one user question
- Have generous vertical spacing
- Feel breathable and calm

---

## UI Principles
- Section-based storytelling
- Light shadows only
- Rounded corners
- Minimal icons
- Emphasis through spacing, not color

---

## Output Expectation
Produce a clear visual system and layout concept
that can be directly translated into React + Tailwind components.
Focus on structure, rhythm, and visual energy,
not decorative imagery.
